## Use Cases
Maven Fuzzy Factory addresses the following business intelligence needs:

1. **Traffic Source Analysis**
     - Analyzing search data and shifting budget towards the engines, campaigns or keywords driving the strongest conversion rates
     - Comparing user behavior patterns across traffic sources to inform creative and messaging strategy
     - Identifying opportunities to eliminate wasted spend or scale high-converting traffics
2. **Landing Page Performance & Testing**
     -  Identifying your top opportunities for landing pages = high volumne pages with higher than expected bounce rates or low conversion rates
     -  Setting up A/B experiments on live traffic to see improvement on bounce rates and conversion rates
     -  Analyzing test results and making recommendations on which version of landing pages you should use going forward 
3. **Channel Portfolio Optimization**
     - Understanding which marketing channels are driving the most sessions and orders through the website
     - Understanding differences in user characteristics and conversion performance across marketing channels
     - Optimizing bids and allocating marketing spend across a multi-channel portfolio to achieve maximum performance 
4. **Product Level Website Analysis**
     - Understanding which products generate the most interest on multi-product showcase pages
     - Analyzing the impact on website conversion rates when you add a new product
     - Building product-specific conversion funnels to understand whether certain products convert better than others
5. **Analyze Repeat Behavior**
     - Analyzing repeat activity to see how often customers are coming back to visit the site
     - Understanding which channels they use when they come back, and whether or not the company is paying for them again through paid channels
     - Using repeat visit activities to build a better understanding of the value of a customer in order to better optimaize marketing channels
6. **Analyzing & Testing Conversion Funnels**
     - Identifying the most common paths customers take before purchasing the company's products
     - Identifying how many users continue on to each next step in the conversion flow, and how many users abandon at each step
     - Optimizing critical pain points where users are abandoning, so that the company can convert more users and sell more products

## Key MySQL Concepts Used
- **Joins:** Inner joins and left joins for combining datasets.
- **Aggregate Functions:** SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, and MIN for summarizing data.
- **Window Functions:** ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and PARTITION for advanced analytical queries.
- **Subqueries:** Nested queries for dynamic filtering and calculations.
- **Indexes:** Optimized table indexing for faster query execution.
- **Temporary Tables:** Store intermediate results that needs to be processed and accessed within the scope of a session
- **Stored Procedures:** Predefined routines to automate repetitive tasks.
