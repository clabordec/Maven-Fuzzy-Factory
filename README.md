# Maven Fuzzy Factory

## Overview
Welcome to **Maven Fuzzy Factory**, a data-driven business intelligence project that leverages the power of **MySQL** to uncover actionable insights and optimize decision-making processes. This repository demonstrates advanced database querying, data modeling, and analysis techniques tailored for business intelligence workflows.

## Purpose
The objective of Maven Fuzzy Factory is to provide an analytical framework for understanding key business metrics such as sales performance, inventory management, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. By using **MySQL**, this project ensures scalability, reliability, and flexibility in handling large datasets and producing meaningful insights.

## Features
- **Robust Database Schema:** A normalized database structure designed for efficient querying and reporting.
- **Advanced SQL Queries:** Comprehensive SQL scripts for:
  - Sales trend analysis
  - Customer segmentation
  - Inventory optimization
  - Profitability assessment
- **Data Modeling:** Clear and concise models that visualize relationships between key business entities such as products, customers, orders, and suppliers.
- **Performance Optimization:** Implementation of indexing, query optimization techniques, and stored procedures to ensure efficient database operations.

## Installation & Setup
Follow the steps below to set up the Maven Fuzzy Factory project:

### Prerequisites
1. MySQL Server version 8.0 or higher.
2. A MySQL client such as MySQL Workbench or a command-line interface.
3. Basic knowledge of SQL.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maven-fuzzy-factory.git
   cd maven-fuzzy-factory
   ```

2. Import the database schema:
   - Locate the `schema.sql` file in the `/database` folder.
   - Execute the script in your MySQL environment to create the database and tables:
     ```sql
     SOURCE /path/to/schema.sql;
     ```

3. Populate the database:
   - Use the `data.sql` file in the `/database` folder to load sample data:
     ```sql
     SOURCE /path/to/data.sql;
     ```

4. Execute queries:
   - Run analytical queries from the `/queries` folder to generate reports and insights.

## Key MySQL Concepts Used
- **Joins:** Inner joins, left joins, and cross joins for combining datasets.
- **Aggregate Functions:** SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, and MIN for summarizing data.
- **Window Functions:** ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and PARTITION for advanced analytical queries.
- **Subqueries:** Nested queries for dynamic filtering and calculations.
- **Indexes:** Optimized table indexing for faster query execution.
- **Stored Procedures:** Predefined routines to automate repetitive tasks.
